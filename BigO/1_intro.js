//BIG O is used to compute time complexity and space complexity in a mathematical way

//Time complexity implies, total time taken to complete number of operation by machine
//Space complexity implies, total memory space consumed by program.

//consider an example, let progam A takes 10 sec to execute program B takes 8 sec to run to calculate same result but A and B can take diff approaches
//According to time complexity Program A is more efficient

//BIG O worst case

//lets say an array 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

//best case to search is finding 1 . best case denoted by omega headphone symbol
//avg case to find 4, denoted by theta
//worst case by big O i.e finding 8
