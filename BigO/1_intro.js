//BIG O is used to compute time complexity and space complexity in a mathematical way

//Time complexity implies, total time taken to complete number of operation by machine
//Space complexity implies, total memory space consumed by program.

//consider an example, let progam A takes 10 sec to execute program B takes 8 sec to run to calculate same result but A and B can take diff approaches
//According to time complexity Program A is more efficient
